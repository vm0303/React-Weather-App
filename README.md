# React-Weather-App

In college, I did a simple weather app using Ajax calls and free weather APIs. However, I forgot to save my old project
and lost it when I did a factory reset on my whole computer.
So, I decided to start this project from scratch, but use React JS and Tailwind CSS to make the website more modern and
cool!

The weather app will have hourly and daily forecasts, a location tagger to get your current location, the local time and
date of the place, and React Toasty to let users know that their request is being processed.
